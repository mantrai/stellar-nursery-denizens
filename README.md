# stellar-nursery-denizens

At this stage this is mainly a learning exercise to test/learn:
* Typescript
* JS/Typescript unit testing
* Project linting/formatting
* Adding/Updating/Using my own projects in NPM

Beyond the above reasons for this project, the goal of this project
is to generate realistic Star systems based upon RTT (traveller) pen and paper rules.

When finished the goals will be:
* Generate star/planet/moon names and other faction(denizen) related info 
* Be written/broken down in such a way that a user can replace denizen with their own, or add more to provide more information.

For example:
If you were running a Star Wars game, you may make a
Hutt denizen class, and using [stellar-nursery](https://github.com/mantrai/stellar-nursery)
generate a star system while the Hutt denizen class will provide Hutt sounding system/planet/moon names and provide the tech level and other info related to the Hutts.

The current Tyr-Commonwealth one is for my 
campaign. The denizens of the Tyr Commonwealth are a mix 
British/Northern Europe and Chinese settlers with a norse bent on naming
and the Tyr Commonwealth Denizen will/should represent this in its generation.
